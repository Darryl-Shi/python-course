#### Working List
- Make a list that includes four careers, such as 'programmer' and 'truck driver'.
- Use the *list.index()* function to find the index of one career in your list.
- Use the *in* function to show that this career is in your list.
- Use the *append()* function to add a new career to your list.
- Use the *insert()* function to add a new career at the beginning of the list.
- Use a loop to show all the careers in your list.

#### Starting From Empty
- Create the list you ended up with in *Working List*, but this time start your file with an empty list and fill it up using *append()* statements.
- Print a statement that tells us what the first career you thought of was.
- Print a statement that tells us what the last career you thought of was.

#### Ordered Working List
- Start with the list you created in *Working List*.
- You are going to print out the list in a number of different orders.
- Each time you print the list, use a for loop rather than printing the raw list.
- Print a message each time telling us what order we should see the list in.
    - Print the list in its original order.
    - Print the list in alphabetical order.
    - Print the list in its original order.
    - Print the list in reverse alphabetical order.
    - Print the list in its original order.
    - Print the list in the reverse order from what it started.
    - Print the list in its original order
    - Permanently sort the list in alphabetical order, and then print it out.
    - Permanently sort the list in reverse alphabetical order, and then print it out.

#### Ordered Numbers
- Make a list of 5 numbers, in a random order.
- You are going to print out the list in a number of different orders.
- Each time you print the list, use a for loop rather than printing the raw list.
- Print a message each time telling us what order we should see the list in.
    - Print the numbers in the original order.
    - Print the numbers in increasing order.
    - Print the numbers in the original order.
    - Print the numbers in decreasing order.
    - Print the numbers in their original order.
    - Print the numbers in the reverse order from how they started.
    - Print the numbers in the original order.
    - Permanently sort the numbers in increasing order, and then print them out.
    - Permanently sort the numbers in descreasing order, and then print them out.

#### List Lengths
- Copy two or three of the lists you made from the previous exercises, or make up two or three new lists.
- Print out a series of statements that tell us how long each list is.


#### Programming Words
- Make a list of the most important words you have learned in programming so far. You should have terms such as list,
- Make a corresponding list of definitions. Fill your list with 'definition'.
