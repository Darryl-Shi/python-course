    "## Exercise 1: Contact Book \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a function** called `add_contact` that:\n",
    "   - Accepts three arguments: `contacts_dict`, `name`, and `phone_number`.\n",
    "   - Adds the contact to `contacts_dict` with `name` as the key and `phone_number` as the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define another function** called `get_contact` that:\n",
    "   - Takes two arguments: `contacts_dict` and `name`.\n",
    "   - Returns the phone number of the specified contact if it exists; otherwise, returns `\"Contact not found\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test the functions by:\n",
    "   - Creating an empty dictionary called `contacts`.\n",
    "   - Adding three contacts to it using `add_contact`.\n",
    "   - Trying to retrieve a contact's phone number using `get_contact`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   contacts = {}\n",
    "   add_contact(contacts, \"Alice\", \"123-456-7890\")\n",
    "   add_contact(contacts, \"Bob\", \"234-567-8901\")\n",
    "   print(get_contact(contacts, \"Alice\"))  # Should output: 123-456-7890\n",
    "   print(get_contact(contacts, \"Charlie\"))  # Should output: Contact not found\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Student Grades \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a function** called `calculate_average` that:\n",
    "   - Accepts a dictionary, `grades_dict`, where each key is a student's name and each value is their grade (integer).\n",
    "   - Calculates and returns the average grade of all students.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define another function** called `find_top_student` that:\n",
    "   - Takes the same `grades_dict` as input.\n",
    "   - Finds and returns the name of the student with the highest grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test the functions by:\n",
    "   - Creating a dictionary called `grades` with at least five students and their grades.\n",
    "   - Calling `calculate_average` to find the class average.\n",
    "   - Calling `find_top_student` to find the student with the highest grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   grades = {\n",
    "       \"Alice\": 88,\n",
    "       \"Bob\": 95,\n",
    "       \"Charlie\": 70,\n",
    "       \"Diana\": 85,\n",
    "       \"Eve\": 92\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   print(calculate_average(grades))  # Should output the average grade\n",
    "   print(find_top_student(grades))  # Should output: Bob (or the student with the highest grade)\n",
    "   ```"
